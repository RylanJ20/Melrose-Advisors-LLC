          <p id="dgmain">
            We start by discussing your needs & use cases to determine whether a
            cloud-based or on-premises, server-based option is the best solution
            to power your software/application modules. Then, we talk over your
            need for the software and application modules to be installed, the
            necessary adaptation & customization work needed to make them
            specific to your operation, and your custom hardware or outside
            software/application technologies that need to communicate with each
            other. Finally, we specify the data to be imported in the system and
            develop a training plan.

          <h3 id="dgright">Digital Growth Marketing</h3>
          <p id="dgright">
            We utilize time trusted methods of growth marketing and integrate
            them with the digital tools we have available to us today. We use
            American Marketing Association certified assessments and market
            research study strategies to gather the data required to help you
            grow. Then we utilize websites, web applications, social media,
            marketing tools, business development partnerships, value added
            reseller opportunities, and allow you to easily connect to those
            resources online through the appropriate channels.

          <p id="dgmain">
            Once we've established your hybrid IT program, integration and
            transition timelines and you see the impact they have on your
            organization, it's time to go to work developing your marketing plan
            and business development opportunities. Planning comes at every
            stage of the process, and we are constantly evaluating for better
            strategies to help you achieve your growth goals.

          <h3 id="dgright">Business Development & Planning</h3>

            We believe that partnerships between companies and integration
            between tools drives the success of business development as a whole
            for the current economy. Proper business planning and financial
            forecasting is necessary for success and you need tools to help you
